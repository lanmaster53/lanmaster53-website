            <p>With Portswigger slashing the price of their Burp Suite Certified Practitioner exam to $9, I couldn't resist buying an attempt and giving it a try. I spent a couple more days preparing and took the certification exam. I didn't get very far in the three hours, completing only a single challenge (step 1 of application 1), but I did learn a little about the environment and wanted to share some of that information with others that may be considering an attempt at becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner. ... <a href="/2021/11/18/burp-suite-certified-practitioner-review-part-2/">more</a></p>

            <p>Portswigger recently announced their <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification">Burp Suite Certified Practitioner certification</a>. As a Burp Suite enthusiast and self-proclaimed subject matter expert, I decided to exercise the certification preparation process as a way to sharpen my skills, provide insight to others on the preparation process, and ultimately decide whether or not I would give the certification exam an attempt myself. Below are my takeaways from the process and thoughts I want to share with others that are considering an attempt at becoming a Burp Suite Certified Practitioner. ... <a href="/2021/11/15/burp-suite-certified-practitioner-review/">more</a></p>

    <h5>Monday, June 14, 2021</h5>
    <div class="content">
            <p>I recently received an email from a previous student asking a question about API discovery during a no-knowledge test. The question was, "How can one discover API's across an organization's external IP range when the API's are not linked like URLs and can't be crawled using traditional means?" I thought my answer might be useful for others, so I'm documenting it here. ... <a href="/2021/06/14/no-knowledge-api-discovery/">more</a></p>

    <div class="content">
            <p>I love teaching for a lot of reasons. One of the reasons is because I learn so much when I teach. Sounds weird doesn't it? Why would the person teaching be learning? Well, It's probably not what you think. Some of what I learn comes directly from the students, but a lot comes from debugging issues on the fly and some dumb-luck discovery when someone in the class accidentally clicks somewhere or mistypes something. Recently I was teaching a class, and a combination of these led to a pretty neat discovery that I want to share with the community. ... <a href="/2019/06/14/dynamic-discovery-mass-assignment/">more</a></p>

            <p>Training has been a significant part of my professional life since 2009. I've never written about my training pursuits, so as I march into my tenth year of training, fifth year of Practical Web Application Penetration Testing (PWAPT), and the first year of Practical Burp Suite Pro: Advanced Tactics (PBAT), I'd like to share a little about where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm going, while specifically addressing my various courses. ... <a href="/2019/02/22/a-decade-of-training/">more</a></p>

    <div class="content">
            <p>If you're my age (born in the early 1980s) and know how to code, then it has likely been a differentiator for you in your career. I can't think of a single thing I've done professionally where my ability to understand programming concepts and write code has not benefited me in some way. However, coding is fast becoming a more common skill set amongst the younger generations. Teaching our kids to code is now more of a necessity and less of a luxury. ... <a href="/2018/12/08/get-off-your-butt-and-teach-your-kids-to-code/">more</a></p>
