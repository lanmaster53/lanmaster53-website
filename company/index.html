<blockquote>
<p><strong>prac·ti·cal</strong>: of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of resources for theory and ideas regarding the many fields of study within the Information Security industry. The missing piece to many of these great resources and the brilliant discoveries we read about on a daily basis is the practical application to our daily jobs. Tim Tomes, the founder of Practical Security Services, spent his career focusing on stripping away the "magic" from these complex theories and ideas and finding ways to make them applicable to what professionals in the Information Security industry do every day. So out of that approach was born the idea of forming a company whose goal is the same. To provide consulting, development, and training services where the practical application of technologies, theories, and ideas result in a high-quality, actionable deliverable and an enhanced skill set.</p>

<h2>Consulting</h2>
<p>With over a decade of experience in the Information Security field, employees of Practical Security Services have had the pleasure of serving in many roles including Senior Red Team Leader (Department of the Army), Senior Security Consultant (Accuvant, Black Hills Information Security), Managing Consultant (Black Hills Information Security, nVisium), Vice President of Professional Services (nVisium), and Director of Training (nVisium). Each of these roles has afforded an opportunity to gain a different perspective of the industry and hone various skills. While experienced in a variety of fields, Practical Security Services also believes that specialization is important to providing a high quality product, and is committed to the field of Application Security. As a consultancy, Practical Security Services offers assistance in conducting application penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, code reviews, and vulnerability research.

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Writing code has been a personal hobby and passion of many Practical Security Services employees since childhood. Throughout their lives and careers, the ability to read and write code has been a stepping stone to becoming a more efficient and effective community contributor and security consultant. As professionals, Practical Security Services continues a lifelong love of code by conducting research in modern development frameworks, managing and maintaining open source software <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, and building the proprietary software on which the company runs. Experience as security consultants and software developers uniquely qualifies Practical Security Services to contribute to development projects where elements of both are desired.
